# Solve the Domino Road Puzzle

My kid got this 3D puzzle as a gift, it's called [Domino Road](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/21593/domino-road). I tried with my wife for 3 nights in a row
trying to connect all the pieces together. It was both a fun challenging.

Then I decided to write some code to find all the possible solutions. Here it is.

# How it works

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
python puzzle_solver.py
```

The code will create solved puzzle solutions as images in `$HOME/Downloads/traffic-puzzle-board`.

# Result

I had a lot of fun, my kid was amazed by what a computer can do.
